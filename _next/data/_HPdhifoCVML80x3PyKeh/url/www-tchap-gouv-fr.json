If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where \"shared\" caching servers such as \"proxy\" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.</p>"}]}]},"nuclei":null,"lhr":[{"requestedUrl":"https://www.tchap.gouv.fr/","finalUrl":"https://tchap.beta.gouv.fr/","fetchTime":"2023-04-19T13:46:55.490Z","runWarnings":["The page may not be loading as expected because your test URL (https://www.tchap.gouv.fr/) was redirected to https://tchap.beta.gouv.fr/.
